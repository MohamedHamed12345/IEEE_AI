### mean and median and The standard deviation
💡==the mean== `tends to be more sensitive to outliers values that are dramatically different from the majority of other values.`
==the median== `did not change as much`

==The standard deviation== `measures how much the individual measurements in a datasets vary from the mean.`

- If there had been more variation in the exam scores, the standard deviation would have been even larger  
- if there had been less variation, the standard deviation would have been smaller.

` The standard deviation for Class A is 5 (small spread), while the standard deviation for Class B is 15 (large spread).`

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{(x_i - \mu)^2}}
$$

### Normal distribution

	`Sometimes a datasets exhibits a particular shape that is evenly distributed around the mean. Such a distribution is called a normal distribution. It can also be called a Gaussian distribution or a bell curve. Although exam grades are not always distributed in this way,`

mean (µ) and the standard deviation (σ).
the term “standard deviation” was first introduced by statistician `Karl Pearson` in 1893

### Skewed Distribution
**Left Skewed Distribution:** Mean < Median < Mode

![Mean vs. median vs. mode in left skewed distribution](https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skew4.png)

In a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median.

**Right Skewed Distribution:** Mode < Median < Mean

![Mean vs. median vs. mode in right skewed distribution](https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skew6.png)

In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median.

**No Skew:** Mean = Median = Mode

![Mean vs. median vs. mode in symmetrical distribution](https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skew5.png)

In a symmetrical distribution the mean, median, and mode are all equal.
