Topics Covered:
- Descriptive Statistics: This is a branch of statistics that involves summarizing and describing the characteristics of a set of data. Descriptive statistics can include measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode), measures of dispersion (such as range and standard deviation), and graphical representations (such as histograms and box plots). Descriptive statistics can be used to gain insights into a dataset and to communicate findings to others.


- Simpson's Paradox: This is a phenomenon in statistics where a trend or relationship that appears in different groups of data disappears or even reverses when the groups are combined. This can occur when the groups have different sizes or when there is a confounding variable that affects the relationship. It is important to be aware of Simpson's paradox when interpreting statistical results, as it can lead to incorrect conclusions.

- Probability: This is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence. Probability can be used to make predictions and decisions in many fields, including science, economics, and finance. It involves concepts such as sample spaces, events, probability distributions, and conditional probability.

- Binomial Distribution: This is a probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure) and the probability of success remains constant throughout the trials. The binomial distribution has a specific formula for calculating the probability of getting a certain number of successes, and it is often used in real-world applications such as quality control and polling.
