Simpson's paradox
is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of
data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.


This result is often encountered in social-science
and medical-science statistics and is particularly problematic when frequency data are unduly given causal
interpretations


Simpson's paradox has been used to illustrate the kind of misleading results that the misuse of statistics can
generate.

Edward H. Simpson first described this phenomenon in a technical paper in 1951

Mathematician Jordan Ellenberg argues that Simpson's paradox is misnamed as "there's no constriction involved,
just two different ways to think about the same data” and suggests that its lesson “isn't really to tell us which
viewpoint to take but to insist that we keep both the parts and the whole in mind at once
