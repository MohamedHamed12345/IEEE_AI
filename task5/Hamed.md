Simpson's paradox
`is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of
`data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.`


`This result is often encountered in social-science
`and medical-science statistics and is particularly problematic when frequency data are unduly given causal
`interpretations`

`
`Simpson's paradox has been used to illustrate the kind of misleading results that the misuse of statistics can
`generate.``

`Edward H. Simpson first described this phenomenon in a technical paper in 1951`

`Mathematician Jordan Ellenberg argues that Simpson's paradox is misnamed as "there's no constriction involved,
`just two different ways to think about the same data” and suggests that its lesson “isn't really to tell us which
`viewpoint to take but to insist that we keep both the parts and the whole in mind at once
