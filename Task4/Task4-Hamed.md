### mean and median and The standard deviation
💡==the mean== `tends to be more sensitive to outliers values that are dramatically different from the majority of other values.`
==the median== `did not change as much`

==The standard deviation== `measures how much the individual measurements in a datasets vary from the mean.`

- If there had been more variation in the exam scores, the standard deviation would have been even larger  
- if there had been less variation, the standard deviation would have been smaller.

` The standard deviation for Class A is 5 (small spread), while the standard deviation for Class B is 15 (large spread).`

## Normal distribution

	`Sometimes a datasets exhibits a particular shape that is evenly distributed around the mean. Such a distribution is called a normal distribution. It can also be called a Gaussian distribution or a bell curve. Although exam grades are not always distributed in this way,`

the term “standard deviation” was first introduced by statistician `Karl Pearson` in 1893
